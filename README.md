## My process
first create the background and set the background and create the container to do eveything on it.

### Built with

### What I learned

i learned a lot about html and css and it easys now caus i remember most of the element and syntax caus of those error and will help me alot in the future. and as for a responsive am still weak for that area.


### Continued development

I would like to continue develop in frontend area so i can do most of the thing without getting stuck and for a responsisve i would like to refine it more and more caus its hard to work with it.
